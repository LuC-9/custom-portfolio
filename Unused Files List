1. components/client-wrappers.tsx
   - Contains dynamic imports that may not be used anymore, especially the CustomCursorClient
   - The globals.css has commented out cursor styles suggesting this feature was removed

2. pnpm-lock.yaml
   - If you're using npm or yarn (as indicated in package.json scripts), this lock file is redundant

3. components/ui/skeleton.tsx
   - No clear usage found in the provided excerpts, may be unused

4. mdx-components.tsx
   - The excerpt shows minimal content, and with @next/mdx configured, this might be a boilerplate file

5. components/blog-footer.tsx
   - May be redundant if you're using the main Footer component for blog pages too

6. .qodo
   - Listed in .gitignore but purpose is unclear, might be a temporary or development-only directory

7. Redundant configuration in package.json
   - Multiple versions of similar packages (React ecosystem has both v18 and v19 dependencies)
   - Some dependencies may be unused (expo, expo-asset, expo-file-system, expo-gl)
